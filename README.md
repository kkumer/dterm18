Extraction of D-term from CLAS cross-section and beam-spin asymmetry data


This is the code for the analysis done for the paper

   * Kumeriƒçki, K., _Measurability of pressure inside the proton_, Nature, 570 (2019) no. 7759, E1-E2,

which is reaction to the paper Burkert, V. D. and Elouadrhiri, L. and Girod, F. X., _The pressure distribution inside the proton_, Nature 557 (2018) no. 7705, 396-399, [doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0060-z](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0060-z).

Jupyter/Python notebook ``dterm.ipynb``  above shows how new results
are obtained and compares results from the two papers.
