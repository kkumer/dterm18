Extraction of D-term from CLAS 2015 cross-section and beam-spin asymmetry data


This is the code for the analysis done for the paper

   * Kumeriƒçki, K., _Measurability of pressure inside the proton_

which is reaction to the paper

   * Burkert, V. D. and Elouadrhiri, L. and Girod, F. X., _The pressure distribution inside the proton_, Nature 557 (2018) no. 7705, 396-399, [doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0060-z](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0060-z)


Jupyter/Python notebook ``dterm.ipynb``  above shows how new results
are obtained and compares results from the two papers.
This file is thoroughly commented and quite readable immediately here on
